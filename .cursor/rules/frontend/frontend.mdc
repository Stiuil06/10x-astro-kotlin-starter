## Frontend

### General Guidelines

- Use Astro components (.astro) for static content and layout
- Implement framework components in React only when interactivity is needed
- Follow the established component architecture with clear separation of concerns
- Organize components by feature and reusability (common, features, layout)

### Guidelines for Styling

#### Tailwind

- Use the @layer directive to organize styles into components, utilities, and base layers
- Use arbitrary values with square brackets (e.g., w-[123px]) for precise one-off designs
- Implement the Tailwind configuration file for customizing theme, plugins, and variants
- Leverage the theme() function in CSS for accessing Tailwind theme values
- Implement dark mode with the dark: variant
- Use responsive variants (sm:, md:, lg:, etc.) for adaptive designs
- Leverage state variants (hover:, focus-visible:, active:, etc.) for interactive elements

### Guidelines for Accessibility

#### ARIA Best Practices

- Use ARIA landmarks to identify regions of the page (main, navigation, search, etc.)
- Apply appropriate ARIA roles to custom interface elements that lack semantic HTML equivalents
- Set aria-expanded and aria-controls for expandable content like accordions and dropdowns
- Use aria-live regions with appropriate politeness settings for dynamic content updates
- Implement aria-hidden to hide decorative or duplicative content from screen readers
- Apply aria-label or aria-labelledby for elements without visible text labels
- Use aria-describedby to associate descriptive text with form inputs or complex elements
- Implement aria-current for indicating the current item in a set, navigation, or process
- Avoid redundant ARIA that duplicates the semantics of native HTML elements

### Component Architecture Guidelines

#### Component Organization
- Place reusable UI components in `src/components/common/`
- Organize feature-specific components in `src/components/features/[feature-name]/`
- Keep layout components in `src/components/layout/`
- Each component should have its own folder with an `index.ts` file for clean exports

#### Import Patterns
- Use clean imports through index files: `import { Button } from '../components/common'`
- Avoid direct file imports: `import { Button } from '../components/common/Button/Button'`
- Group related imports together (components, hooks, types)

#### Component Structure
- Each component folder should contain:
  - `ComponentName.tsx` - Main component file
  - `index.ts` - Export file for clean imports
- Use TypeScript interfaces for all props
- Implement proper error boundaries for API failures
- Use React.memo() for expensive components that render often
